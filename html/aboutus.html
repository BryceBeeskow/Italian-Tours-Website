            <p>Hello everyone and welcome to Italian Adventures.
            Italian Adventures was started 18 years ago by two friends 
	         out of college who love adventure. Itâ€™s been a lot of years, but 
	        we still love tracking across Italy with new people.  The company 
	        is bigger now, but the sense of adventure continues to call. </p>            
            <p>Please come and join us.
            We have several packages to choose from. You can choose one of our high 
            adventure packages, where there is a lot of exploring and backpacking 
            involved, or a more sedentary trip that invites you to enjoy the culture 
            and food of all the areas that you can visit.</p>

        <section class="full-width">
            <h3>Our Goal:</h3>
            <p>Our goal is your satisfaction regardless of the package. We hope that you and a friend would try both, 
            just we did 18 years ago. You never know, it might be just what your friendship needed.  </p>
